# Demo Checklist

In-page (no build step), dead-simple checklist for whatever you want. I made
this for a visual way to show what is happening while I record demo videos. You
can do as much or as little as you would like with it.

You can open this file directly with your browser - you do not need to build
anything, you do not need a webserver, you do not need anything at all.


## Instant Start

- Step 1: Open index.html with your browser
- Step 2: There is no step 2!
